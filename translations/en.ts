    the technical specifications that have been developed by [Govstack](https://www.govstack.global/)
    for various [Building Blocks](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/). For each
    Building Blocks a series of APIs have been defined and tests have been developed which any compliant
    product must be able to pass. These tests are run against candidate platforms and this application 
    provides detailed information on which tests are passing and which are failing. Users may select any
    building block that they are interested and view candidate products as well as their current level
    of compliance with the API.`,
