Application setup is done through environmental variables. 
The following variables are used:

### Connection with MongoDB

Env variables that regex matches `API_KEY_*` pattern are used to determine lists of API keys authorized to push report results to the storage. API keys have to be passed as an `x-api-key` header in incoming requests.
